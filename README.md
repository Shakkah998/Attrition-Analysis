# 👥 HR Attrition Analysis – Atlas Lab Dashboard

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project uses **Power BI dashboards** to analyze attrition data for Atlas Lab. By examining employee demographics, performance metrics, and attrition trends, the dashboard helps uncover key drivers of turnover, enabling HR teams and managers to make data-driven decisions to improve retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Visualize attrition rates over time and by department.  
- Examine demographic factors (age, gender, role) affecting attrition.  
- Assess employee performance in relation to retention.  
- Identify opportunities for intervention to reduce turnover.

---

## 📂 Data Sources  
- Internal employee records with demographic details (age, gender, department, job role)  
- Performance metrics and attrition history (who left, when, and under what conditions)  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** for building dashboards and visual analytics  
- **DAX** for computed measures and metrics  
- Power Query for data preparation and transformation

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. Data import: Bring in HR/employee and attrition datasets into Power BI.  
2. Data cleaning: Standardize fields, remove inconsistencies, handle missing values.  
3. Exploratory Analysis: Review demographic distributions, performance, and attrition over time.  
4. Data modeling: Build relationships, calculate attrition rates and metrics via DAX.  
5. Dashboard construction: Develop dashboards including overview, demographics, attrition trends, and performance tracker.

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- Departments with higher turnover over time are visible (specific departments)  
- Certain demographic groups show higher attrition rates (by age, gender, or job role)  
- Employee performance metrics are correlated with retention (lower performance often precedes attrition)  
- Time-based spikes in departures indicate possible external or organizational triggers
